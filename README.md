## College-Chatbot API 

## Abstract
During the admissions process or for other reasons, students frequently need to visit universities or schools to gather information about numerous topics such tuition costs, term schedules, etc. A chatbot can be created as a result to solve the issues. The idea focusses upon user-chatbot interaction, which can be accessible from anywhere at any time.Â The project makes use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. A Feed-Forward PyTorch Neural Network with two layers, ReLU activation, and Cross-Entropy Loss is used to optimize the parameters in chatbot model. To rapidly exchange messages between the client and server, a socket connection is essential. This is due to the fact that a straightforward HTTP connection cannot guarantee real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. For the chatbot API, the project will utilize FastAPI since it offers a quick and up-to-date Python server for our purpose and MongoDB for storing model state and datasets. The mobile application is developed using React-Native and built via Expo Application Services, only android devices are supported. In addition, there is a Web Application that acts as admin interface for the Chatbot API which is implemented using React JS.
